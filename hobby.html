		<strong>MY HOBBIES</strong>

<p> 
Regarding the <strong>hobbies</strong>, I don't have many of them,<br>due to my work, which takes much of my time
</p>


<p>
However, I have some things, which I like to do most of all.<br>Here they are!
</p>

		<strong>Frontend development</strong> courses.

		 I like to lean something new,<br>so it's a good chance for me not just<br>to lean <em>something new</em>,<br>but also to have a <strong>profit</strong> of it.
