<p>Inland from Australia’s famed Great Ocean Road, the cool rainforests of the 
Great Otway National Park are home to massive tree ferns and cackling kookaburras.
 The rainforest is dotted with impressive waterfalls like the Erskine and Henderson 
falls, and in the park’s south, swaying eucalyptus trees along Otway Lighthouse Road 
teem with lazy koalas.Colorful bird, plant, and insect life bring this damp, mountainous jungle alive. 
Keep a lookout for hummingbirds (you won’t have to look hard) and toucans, orchids, 
and air plants that look like they belong in an Urban Outfitters. </p><p>Birdwatchers here 
are almost as prolific as the birds themselves, so be open to trying new hobbies.
The turbulent Pacific waters off of California’s coast provide the perfect supply of 
nutrients for fast-growing giant kelp, which can gain 10-12 inches in just one day
 and have formed dense underwater forests along the shores of Monterey. If you are 
not for SCUBA, the renowned Monterey Bay Aquarium is home to a groundbreaking kelp 
forest exhibit where local inhabitants include sardines, leopard sharks, and eels. 
If you do the dive yourself, sea lion sightings are almost guaranteed.</p>

<p>Once you hop in a boat at Muyil, Mayan-dug canals through sprawling tracts mangroves 
are at your fingertips. Though this reserve is home to plenty of crocs, the canal 
waters are crystal clear, and most tours climax in a current-driven, boatless
 free-float. Look for dolphins and sea turtles amongst the mangroves, but don’t 
expect to set eyes on any of the five species of wildcats that call this reserve 
home -- they like to play at night.</p>

<p>OK, so this is more of a rock forest, per say,  but the main draw at Tsingy is the
 ancient limestone formations that cover the 230-square-mile UNESCO site. A day-long
 trek through the region’s cave-like crevices and across janky rope bridges reveals
 a look into the life of 11 types of lemur, camouflaged chameleons, and various species
 of birds. Just be sure to focus on your footwork.</p>
